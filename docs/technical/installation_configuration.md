# Installation and Configuration Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the necessary components to get the TrustD POC platform up and running. This guide is intended for system administrators and developers who are responsible for setting up the TrustD POC environment.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation process, ensure that you have:

- A modern operating system capable of running Docker (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
- Docker installed on your machine. If you do not have Docker installed, follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Docker Compose installed, for orchestrating multiple Docker containers. Install Docker Compose by following the instructions on the [official Docker Compose website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the TrustD POC repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[TRUSTD]/trustd_poc.git
cd trustd_poc
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the project directory and copy the sample environment variables file to create your own `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file using your preferred text editor to set up your environment variables. This file will typically include database configurations, API keys, and other platform-specific settings.

## Step 3: Build and Run with Docker Compose

With Docker and Docker Compose installed, and your environment variables configured, you can now build and run the TrustD POC platform. From the root of the project directory, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the Docker images for the TrustD POC platform and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Wait for the process to complete, and ensure all services are up and running without errors.

## Step 4: Verifying the Installation

Once the Docker containers are running, you can verify the installation by accessing the TrustD POC web interface. Open a web browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:[PORT]
```

Replace `PORT` with the actual port number configured for accessing the TrustD POC platform, as specified in your `.env` file or `docker-compose.yml`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the installation process, review the container logs for any error messages:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

Common issues may include incorrect environment variable settings, issues connecting to external services, or permission errors. Adjust your configuration as necessary and restart the Docker containers.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed and configured the TrustD POC platform. For detailed documentation on using the platform and managing Verifiable Credentials, refer to the User Documentation and Technical Documentation sections of this guide.
