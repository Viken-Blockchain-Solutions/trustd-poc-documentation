This model facilitates a decentralized and user-centric approach to identity verification, where individuals or organizations can own, control, and share their credentials securely and with privacy. System Components Dock.io Platform The Dock.io platform serves as the backbone of the Trustd POC, enabling the issuance, holding, and verification of Verifiable Credentials (VCs). It provides a decentralized network for secure and verifiable transactions, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the credentials issued and shared within the Trustd ecosystem. Participants Issuer : An entity, typically a business or organization, that issues digital credentials to individuals or other entities. In the Trustd POC, the issuer is a Trustd Verified business that issues a Vehicle Insurance Certificate to a holder. Holder : An individual or entity that receives and stores digital credentials in their Dock.io wallet app. The holder can share their credentials with verifiers as needed. Verifier : An entity that requests and verifies digital credentials from holders to confirm their authenticity and validity. Verifiers in the Trustd ecosystem can also verify credentials belonging to the issuer. Architecture Flow Issuance of 'Trustd Verified Issuer' Credential : A business becomes 'Trustd Verified', and Trustd issues a 'Trustd Verified Issuer' verifiable credential to the Issuer. Credential Issuance to Holder : The issuer issues a Verifiable Credential, such as a Vehicle Insurance Certificate, to the holder through the Dock.io platform. This process involves selecting a Trustd verified user, populating the credential metadata, and either issuing the credential directly to the holder's DID or via email. Credential Acceptance by Holder : The holder accepts the credential in their Dock.io wallet app, securely storing it for future verification requests. Verification Request by Verifier : A verifier accesses a view where they can verify the credentials of entities appearing in their carrier list. The verifier sends a verification request to the holder. Credential Presentation and Verification : The holder presents the requested VC to the verifier, including any selectively disclosed attributes. The verifier confirms the credential's authenticity and validity. Key Features Granular and Permissioned Data Sharing : Holders can control which attributes of their credentials are shared with verifiers, enhancing privacy and data security. Decentralized Identity (DID) : Utilizes decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for secure and direct identification of entities within the ecosystem. 'Trustd Verified' Watermarks : Credentials and documents presented within the system bear a 'Verified by Trustd' watermark, signifying their verified status. Conclusion The Trustd POC architecture represents a significant advancement in identity verification within the Transport and Logistics industry. By leveraging the SSI model through the Dock.io platform, the Trustd ecosystem facilitates a more efficient, secure, and user-controlled method of sharing and verifying digital credentials.","title":"Trustd POC Architecture Overview"},{"location":"architecture/#trustd-poc-architecture-overview","text":"","title":"Trustd POC Architecture Overview"},{"location":"architecture/#introduction","text":"The Trustd Proof of Concept (POC) aims to streamline identity interactions and transactions within the Transport and Logistics industry by leveraging the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model.

This document elaborates on these concepts and their significance within the TrustD ecosystem. Verifiable Credentials (VC) Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital equivalents of traditional paper-based credentials, like a driver's license or university diploma, but with enhanced security, privacy, and verifiability features. They play a pivotal role in the TrustD POC project, leveraging blockchain technology to transform how identities and credentials are verified within the Transport and Logistics industry. Importance in the Digital Verification Process VCs are crucial in establishing a trust framework that is independent of centralized verification authorities. This trust is achieved through cryptographic proofs that confirm the integrity and origin of the credential without disclosing more information than necessary. This property is particularly important in the Transport and Logistics industry, where businesses often need to verify credentials such as vehicle insurance certificates, driver qualifications, and company certifications rapidly and securely. Standards and Protocols The TrustD POC project adheres to established standards and protocols for the creation, issuance, and verification of VCs to ensure interoperability, security, and privacy: W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model TrustD utilizes the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model , which provides a standardized method to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable. This standard defines a generic model to create VCs that can be shared across different platforms without requiring a centralized issuer or verifier. Decentralized Identifiers (DID) DIDs are a new type of identifier for verifiable, \"self-sovereign\" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. In the context of TrustD, DIDs are used to securely associate issuers, holders, and verifiers with their digital identities, enabling a more direct and secure form of identity verification. Dock.io Blockchain The Dock.io blockchain plays a critical role in the anchoring of VCs. By recording a hash of the VC on a decentralized ledger, TrustD ensures that each credential can be verified as untampered and authentic. This process leverages the immutable nature of blockchain technology to provide a time-stamped record of credential issuance and revocation, enhancing the overall trust in the digital verification process. Implementation on the TrustD Platform On the TrustD platform, the issuance and verification of VCs follow a streamlined process: Issuance : An issuer, after becoming 'Trustd Verified', creates a VC for a holder, embedding the necessary claims and signing it cryptographically. Acceptance : The holder accepts the VC, storing it securely in their digital wallet. Verification : A verifier requests proof of a specific claim within the VC. The holder presents a verification derived from the VC, which the verifier checks against the public key recorded on the blockchain. This end-to-end process not only simplifies the verification of credentials but also significantly enhances security and privacy, mitigating the risk of fraud and unauthorized data disclosure.","title":"Key Concepts and Technologies"},{"location":"technical/key_concepts/#key-concepts-and-technologies","text":"The TrustD Proof of Concept (POC) introduces several foundational concepts and technologies crucial for understanding how the platform operates.
